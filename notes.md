Had a chat with Niall about messaging for the world climate simulation.

## Messaging/Outreach

1. "Framing" - tailor your message to the values of your audience.
2. Make sure that you emphasize what the participants will each personally "get out" of the event. A certificate? a skill? an opportunity? free food?
