## Agenda

### Catchup

1. Event is scheduled: **April 18 14:00-16:00 CB 5.12** (We have CB 5.12 from 13:00-17:00).
2. Shorter format (only ~2 hours!)
3. Roles (see [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R17N4lF4La5fZJ8VGqeBig48MHRJgRMLmvZigt6J-to/edit#gid=0))

### Food

What sort of food do we expect to get and how much will it cost?

Also, we should check [room food policy](http://www.bath.ac.uk/timetable/Food%20and%20drink%20policy.pdf)

Use  [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R17N4lF4La5fZJ8VGqeBig48MHRJgRMLmvZigt6J-to/edit#gid=0) to calculate the estimated cost.

**We need someone to take on the role of ordering food, making sure it arrives on the day, and billing it / getting it reimbursed.**

### Funding 

Where will we get funding for the food?

### Materials

Steve is coordinating materials. If anyone has materials to contribute please chat with Steve.


### Publicity

Niall, do you need any more details for publicity? Do you need help printing,  distributing materials or otherwise?
