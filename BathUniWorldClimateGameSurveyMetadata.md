## World Climate Game Event Summary

**Summary:** This event was organised by the University of Bath Sustainability Postgraduates society ( https://www.facebook.com/BathSustainabilityPostgrads/ ), and was open to anyone within the University of Bath community. The majority of attendees were PhD Students within the University, in the sciences and engineering. A few undergraduates and academics were also present.

We plan to hold another such event this summer for international students seeking to practice their English skills while also learning about climate change issues, and another this autumn as a orientation week event to attract new members to the sustainability society and continue to raise awareness.

**Detailed Feedback on Game From Coordinators:** We found that the materials provided did not provide very good quantitative information regarding the economic costs of emissions reductions in each country. Many of our participants in trial games felt that they didn't know how to weigh the cost vs. benefit of making emissions reductions commitments because they couldn't quantify the costs or social impacts of emissions reductions commitments. As such, for the real event, we emphasised the use of the McKinsey Abatement Cost Curve provided in the materials, and provided a practical demonstration of how to use the cost curve to perform back-of-the envelope calculations for costing emissions reductions commitments. Even with this preparation, participants struggled with the question of how much they could realistically reduce without causing major economic or social damage in their country regions. One participant pointed out that assuming a country had all of the emissions reductions opportunities provided in the global emissions abatement cost curve, simply pursuing all of them would result in roughly net zero cost over the 20-year return period, because the area of the positive region of the graph is roughly equal to the area of the negative area of the graph.

Participants also struggled to digest the country pack information quickly enough to feel confident about making informed reductions commitments. Participants didn't feel that they understood the situation in their country region well enough to make a strong case for negotiations. Most eventually settled with identifying a few characteristics of their group compared to the others (more / less developed, faster / slower-growing population), and a bit of theatrical imagination to form and pursue a negotiation strategy.

We created our own slide presentation for our World Climate event ( https://slides.com/aurimasmb/worldclimate/#/ ), based on the one provided in the materials. We added some additional interactive data graphics and hosted live online so that wandering "UNEP Climate Scientists" with iPads could help the various country groups with quick fact checks regarding population, emissions statistics, economic indicators, etc.
