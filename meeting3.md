## Agenda

### Trial Game

[Went well. learned some stuff.](./trialgame.md)

```
We had a great trial of the world climate negotiations game yesterday. The full notes can be found here.
 
A few key action items:
 
1.       Steve will follow up on finding more information regarding the economic costs of emissions reductions for each country (getting in touch with Alaa, whose research was on this topic).
2.       Alastair will compile info regarding personal carbon footprint calculation and opportunities for reducing personal impact, and also compile info regarding effective climate / social charities, through 3rd party organisations like Givewell.
3.       Auri will compile information regarding personal carbon offsetting.
4.       We still need someone to collect information regarding the expected impacts of exceeding 1.5 and 2 C, and other effects of climate change and compile this into a few PowerPoint slides. Does someone feel like they might know something about this and would like to contribute?
 
For anyone compiling this additional information for the game, please put together the information into 1 or 2 succinct PowerPoint slides, with references to sources. We will add these slides into the facilitator presentation for the event.

## Notes

### Trial Game

Adding a few slides to the facilitator powerpoint:

* Maya - impacts.
* Cat - social impacts (Cape Town, etc.)

Why 2 C? 

What about 1.5?  etc.

IPCC references??

### Funding

Doctoral College has formalised / closed funding.

But may be available soon?

The SU may be able to provide funding. And BSP is ? eligible?
The SU may be more strict about buying from Uni Catering.

But Maya has received no confirmation. 

But Maya will follow up to ask.

It will likely be a reimbursement-style purchase.

### Publicity

**Maya will do twitter publicity**

Twitter handle: bathsu??

### Post World Climate Event

An event to keep the momentum going, bring new members into BSP activities.

Measuring impact / feedback?

Doctoral College might like some tangible impacts...
