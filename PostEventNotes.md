### Gameplay & Resources

Steve says: Even with a small number of people in general, and specifically in the activist groups, people did seem to get quite into the negotiations.

Steve says: You want to make sure that every group has interacted with every other group at least a little bit. You may need to allow enough time for that.

Steve says: It would have been really good to have someone going around with a computer where people can actually check on facts / data.

Antiopi mentioned it would have been nice to have a bit more time to do the quantitative analysis.

Alastair says: 10 gallon hat for the fossil fuel lobbyists, so that everyone knows that they are not just trolling.

Alastair says: present the economic data a little bit later, after the first round. The idea being not to overload people with complex information too early on.

Alastair says: country information packs don't do a good job of explaining the existing sustainability commitments, and historical and future trends of emissions. For example: when are we peaking? How much are we increasing / decreasing by each year already? Also there is a potential disagreement between the country information pack and the CROADS model. Country information pack says USA peaked already, but CROADS was slightly increasing.

Auri says: Someone pointed out that the total area under the cost abatement curve summed to about 0, so why would a country not just invest in all of those technologies at the same time? How do we know which ones are appropriate for our country group?

### Post-Game Advocacy 

Encourage students to push for sustainability issues on the NSS.

Use the climate game as a fun way to attract new members to BSP and Bath people and planet!

### Uni Bath Organisation

Steve says: cleaning up food should be organised in advance.

Steve says: Tell people what they can and cannot write on if we want mats to be reusable.

This event was organised by the University of Bath Sustainability Postgraduates society ( https://www.facebook.com/BathSustainabilityPostgrads/ , and was open to anyone within the University of Bath community. The majority of attendees were PhD Students within the University, in the sciences and engineering. A few undergraduates and academics were also present.

We plan to hold another such event this summer for international students seeking to practice their English skills while also learning about climate change issues, and another this autumn as a orientation week event to attract new members to the sustainability society and continue to raise awareness.

We found that the materials provided did not provide very good quantitative information regarding the economic costs of emissions reductions in each country. Many of our participants in trial games complained that they didn't know how to weigh the cost vs. benefit of making emissions reductions commitments because they couldn't quantify the costs or social impacts of emissions reductions commitments. As such, for the real event, we emphasised the use of the McKinsey Abatement Cost Curve provided in the materials, and provided a practical demonstration of how to use the cost curve to perform back-of-the envelope calculations for costing emissions reductions commitments. Even with this preparation, participants struggled with the question of how much they could realistically reduce without causing major economic or social damage in their country regions. One participant pointed out that assuming a country had all of the emissions reductions opportunities provided in the global emissions abatement cost curve, simply pursuing all of them would result in roughly net zero cost over the 20-year return period, because the area of the positive region of the graph is roughly equal to the area of the negative area of the graph.

Participants also struggled to digest the country pack information quickly enough to feel confident about making informed reductions commitments. Participants didn't feel that they understood the situation in their country region well enough to make a strong case for negotiations. Most eventually settled with identifying a few characteristics of their group compared to the others (more / less developed, faster / slower-growing population), and a bit of theatrical imagination to form and pursue a negotiation strategy.

We created our own slide presentation for our World Climate event ( https://slides.com/aurimasmb/worldclimate/#/ ), based on the one provided in the materials. We added some additional interactive data graphics and hosted live online so that wandering "UNEP Climate Scientists" with iPads could help the various country groups with quick fact checks regarding population, emissions statistics, economic indicators, etc.
