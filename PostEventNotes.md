## Notes



### Gameplay & Resources

Steve says: Even with a small number of people in general, and specifically in the activist groups, people did seem to get quite into the negotiations.

Steve says: You want to make sure that every group has interacted with every other group at least a little bit. You may need to allow enough time for that.

Steve says: It would have been really good to have someone going around with a computer where people can actually check on facts / data.

Antiopi mentioned it would have been nice to have a bit more time to do the quantitative analysis.

Alastair says: 10 gallon hat for the fossil fuel lobbyists, so that everyone knows that they are not just trolling.

Alastair says: present the economic data a little bit later, after the first round. The idea being not to overload people with complex information too early on.

Alastair says: country information packs don't do a good job of explaining the existing sustainability commitments, and historical and future trends of emissions. For example: when are we peaking? How much are we increasing / decreasing by each year already? Also there is a potential disagreement between the country information pack and the CROADS model. Country information pack says USA peaked already, but CROADS was slightly increasing.

Auri says: Someone pointed out that the total area under the cost abatement curve summed to about 0, so why would a country not just invest in all of those technologies at the same time? How do we know which ones are appropriate for our country group?

### Uni Bath Organisation

Steve says: cleaning up food should be organised in advance.

Steve says: Tell people what they can and cannot write on if we want mats to be reusable.
