Room Setup:

The room should be set up with:
• Tables and chairs or areas on the floor for the teams. Each table or area should have:
o Alabelwithgroup’sname(tabletent),
o BriefingStatementsfortheteam(approximatelyoneperteam
member),
o 2-3 ProposalForms.
• A computer with access to the C-ROADS World Climate simulator (downloaded to the local computer or running online) and PowerPoint slides, a projector, and a screen in the center of the front area.
• A white board (or big pieces of paper) with a large grid for participants to write their commitments that everyone can read from their seats (figure 1).
• A flip chart with pre-drawn diagrams (figure 2 & 3).
• A blue tarp near the area where the ‘Other Developing Countries’ will sit, which
will be used to symbolize sea level rise.
• Somewhere out of sight, such as outside the room or in the back, store your
more formal clothes or accessories for acting as the UN Secretary General or as UNFCCC Executive Secretary, e.g., a tie, blazer, or scarf.
Though this is what we have found to work best for us after many events, you can always mix and match pieces to suit your needs.
