_2018 02 26_

Attended: 

* Auri
* Steve
* Valeria
* Alastair

## Agenda

1. Try out the game to see what we need to keep in mind, any modifications additions we should make, etc.

## Notes

1. Make sure to actually use the [powerpoint provided for facilitators](https://www.climateinteractive.org/programs/world-climate/instructor-resources/slide-sets/).
2. Post the proposal table in a visible place for all groups (maybe on the white board)?
3. Explain the graph of peak, year of reduction graph and what that looks like.
4. Explain the roles of degegates:
  1. To represent and promote the interests of your constituents.
  2. To represent and promote the interests of the world as a whole, which includes your constituents.
5. Revise climate change science history?
  1. first knowledge, various phases?
6. Get a better understanding of the costs of emissions reductions for each country, and present this material in some way to delegates. **Steve will ask Alaa about this.**
7. Make sure to give delegates an introduction and overview of the material they expect to see on their briefing materials.
8. Illustrate in greater detail the consequences of exceeding 1, 1.5 and 2 C global average temperature rise. **Who can be responsible for collecting, compiling this information into a presentation format? Maybe Sonia, as climate scientist?**
  * Try to find David Coley's habitable zones map.
  * Extreme weather events.
  * Coral bleaching
9. Demonstrate early on how ambitious emissions reductions commitments need to be to have an effect. Maybe show the business as usual scenario, and then also show the scenario with even a huge commitment from one country.
10. In debrief:
  * try to give hope?
  * talk about personal action:
    * personal carbon footprinting **Alastair will compile information regarding personal carbon footprinting.**
    * offsetting **Auri will compile information regarding personal carbon offsetting.**
    * charitable donations **Alastair will compile information regarding effective charitable donations.**
